## Specifications Summary
- **Target Gain:** Required gain of 26.02 dB; achieved 21 dB (180nm) and 23.3 dB (22nm).
- **Power Dissipation:** Requirement < 5mW; achieved 0.05121mW (180nm) and 0.0231mW (22nm).
- **Unity Gain Bandwidth (UGB):** Requirement > 500kHz; achieved 150 MHz (180nm) and 220 MHz (22nm).
- **Frequency Response:** Both technologies demonstrated low-pass filter behavior and met all specifications.

## Comparative Analysis: 180nm vs. 22nm
- 22nm technology shows lower Vbias values and current, resulting in reduced power consumption.
- Unity gain bandwidth and cutoff frequency are higher in 22nm technology.
- 22nm MOSFETs are much smaller, enabling denser layouts and improved performance, but layout design is more challenging.
